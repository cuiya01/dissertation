Along with the popularity and prevalence of IoT, it has been used in a large number of fields such as smart agriculture, smart city, smart logistics, etc. Sensors with various functions provide real-time/accurate data and upload them to cloud servers for better management. Choosing an efficient and inexpensive network can optimize peopleâ€™s works during this process. Nowadays, LoRa is considered as one of the most popular technologies that are widely used in IoT field because of its ability to transmit data over long distances and its low price.
However, when a site starts to deploy LoRa gateways, issues such as signal coverage and signal strength need to be considered first. LoRa signals do not change regularly with the increase of distance, and are often affected by obstacles and co-location networks.
In this experiment, I focused on the effects of obstacles on LoRa and how these obstacles can affect that of signal strength and signal range. As the project progresses, I gathered enough data among a range of location covered by LoRa signals and analyzed the possible reason why obstacles affect its signal strength and signal range. his finding can also be extended to future works in the field of wireless protocol in IoT fields.
